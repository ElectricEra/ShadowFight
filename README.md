# ShadowFight

This is a mini-game I had in my head for a long time.

I've decided to use pure JS and CSS to master my skills.

Currently, all visuals - are temporary. 
I've just started my work on this project and have so many ideas, that it is hard to start writing clean, maintainable code.

What will be next:

- More minions to come
- There will be ability to create your own minions
- Completely rewritten design
- Better animation
- Code refactoring

What is planned:

- Minions will have auras
- Interactive fight (drag/drop minions to fight)
- (Probably) sound

It will be hard to stick to this plan, because of numerous ideas, but I will try.
